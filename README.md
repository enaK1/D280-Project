# WorldMap

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

This is my submission for course D280 at Western Governors University. It is a map of the world that uses the World Bank (http://www.worldbank.org/) API to show information related to the country the mouse pointer is hovering.
